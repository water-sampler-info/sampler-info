## Interrogator cable/ISCO sampler to USB adapter
The .pdf schematic shows wiring and required parts for an adapter between a cable with an Amphenol connector and a TTL-USB cable. This will allow you to connect your sampler directly to your USB port. You can easily build this on perfboard or a breadboard. If you want to make pcbs, the zipped gerber contains manufacturing files. Upload the zip file and order from OSH Park, Seeed studio, or any other fine purveyor of circuit boards. Put it in a waterproof box or pot with epoxy. The holes in the board may be used as strain reliefs.
